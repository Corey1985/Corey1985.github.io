*
* 0. JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more. These operators allow a for more 
*flexible and readable code. This flexibility allows for multiple ways of writing said code.
*
* 1. An assignment operator assigns the value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal =, 
*which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, c = d assigns the value of c to d.
*
* 2. An arithmetic operator takes numerical values as their operands and returns a numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition +,
*subtraction -, multiplication *, and division /. These operators work as they do in most other programming languages when used with floating 
*point numbers (note that division by zero produces Infinity).
