/**
*Operators:
*
*-//Descriptions//-
*
* 0. JavaScript operators are used in relation to values in order to assign, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, . These operators allow for a more 
*flexible and readable code. This flexibility allows for multiple ways of writing said code.
*
* 1. An assignment operator is a single equal sign =. The value on the left is assigned to the value on the right. This is generally first used when assigining 
*a variable to a value.
*
* 2. An arithmetic operator is used to describe math to be computed. Basic arithmetic operators are addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, and division /.
*Using division with zero produces Infinity. Infinity is a numeric value representing infinity which is greater than any number.
*
* 3. A comparison operator gives a boolean value of true or false based on the expression. The symbols used for the operators are greater than >, less than <, 
*loosely equal ==, strictly equal ===, not equal !=, not strictly equal !==, greater than or equal to >=, and less than or equal to <=. The comparison is determined
*from left to right.
*
* 4. The three Logical operators are &&, ||, and !. The double ampersand && symbol accepts another set of comparison and if BOTH comparisons are true then it is 
*considered true, false otherwise. The or || symbol is like && but returns true if EITHER expression is true. The not ! operator gives an opposite boolean based on 
*the expression.
*
* 5. Unary operators 
*
* 6. Ternary
